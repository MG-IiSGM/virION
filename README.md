# CovidION

Pipeline for analysis of SARS-CoV-2 MinION samples

For the development of this pipeline it is necessary to download [Guppy](https://community.nanoporetech.com/downloads/guppy/release_notes) from [Nanopore](https://community.nanoporetech.com/downloads) for the basecalling and de-multiplexing steps. If you have used [MinKNOW](https://community.nanoporetech.com/downloads/minion_release/release_notes) to obtain the .fast5 files, you can also perform these steps within the same software.
